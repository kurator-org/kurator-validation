The [kurator-validation](https://github.com/kurator-org/kurator-validation) repository provides libraries, actors, and workflows for validating and cleaning biodiversity data. The code libraries may be used directly from Python scripts, while the actors and workflows work with the [Kurator-Akka](https://github.com/kurator-org/kurator-akka) scientific workflow framework.  This software toolkit is being developed as part of the [Kurator project](http://wiki.datakurator.net/web/Kurator).

This README describes how one Python class in the library, [WoRMSService](https://github.com/kurator-org/kurator-validation/blob/master/src/main/resources/python/kurator/validation/services/WoRMSService.py), both can be used directly within a Python script and as an actor in an Akka-based [workflow](https://github.com/kurator-org/kurator-validation/blob/master/src/main/resources/org/kurator/validation/workflows/WoRMS_name_validation.yaml).  Both the script and the workflow validate and correct the scientific name and authorship fields in a set of input specimen records using the [WoRMS web service](http://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice) to look up taxon names in the standard WoRMS taxononmy.
