# This workflow:
#    - downloads a Darwin Core Archive from a URL
#    - extracts the core file of a Darwin Core Archive to a tab-separated text file
#    - extracts distinct values of a set of fields from the text file
#    - writes the distinct value lists to report files
#
# Example command-line usage:
# kurator -f dwca_assess_controlled_terms.yaml 
#         -p workspace=./wscontermassess
#         -p url=http://ipt.vertnet.org:8080/ipt/archive.do?r=ccber_mammals
#         -l DEBUG (optional)
#
# Requires:
# jython pip install requests
# jython pip install python-dwca-reader
# jython pip install py
# jython pip install unicodecsv
# jython pip install unidecode
