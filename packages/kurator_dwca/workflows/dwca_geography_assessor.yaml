# This workflow:
#    - creates a given directory as a workspace
#    - downloads a geography lookup file
#    - downloads a country lookup file
#    - downloads a given Darwin Core Archive from a URL
#    - extracts the core file of a Darwin Core Archive to a tab-separated text file
#    - extracts distinct values of various geography fields
#    - reports recommendations for geography
#    - reports counts of distinct geography combinations
#    - reports combinations of geography not found in the geography lookup file
#    - reports counts of distinct original country values
#    - reports countries not found in the country lookup file
#    - wraps up the workflow
#
# Example command-line usage:
# kurator -f dwca_geography_assessor.yaml 
#         -p workspace=./dwca_geography_assessor_workspace
