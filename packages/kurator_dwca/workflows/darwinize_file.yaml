# This workflow:
#    - creates a given directory as a workspace
#    - takes a file name as an option
#    - takes an output format (csv, txt) as an option
#    - creates an output file with as many fields standardized to Darwin Core as possible
#    - wraps up the workflow
#
# Example command-line usage:
# kurator -f darwinize_file.yaml 
#         -p workspace=./darwinize_file_workspace
#         -p format=txt
#         -p namespace=yes
#         -l DEBUG (optional)
