# This workflow:
#    - creates a given directory as a workspace
#    - downloads a geography lookup file
#    - downloads a country lookup file
#    - downloads a given Darwin Core Archive from a URL
#    - extracts the core file of a Darwin Core Archive to a tab-separated text file
#    - extracts distinct values of various geography fields
#    - reports recommendations for geography
#    - reports counts of distinct geography combinations
#    - reports combinations of geography not found in the geography lookup file
#    - reports counts of distinct original country values
#    - reports countries not found in the country lookup file
#    - wraps up the workflow
#
# Example command-line usage:
# kurator -f dwca_geography_cleaner.yaml 
#         -p workspace=./dwca_geography_cleaner_workspace
#         -p dwca_url=http://ipt.vertnet.org:8080/ipt/archive.do?r=ccber_mammals

# jython pip install requests
# jython pip install python-dwca-reader
# jython pip install py
