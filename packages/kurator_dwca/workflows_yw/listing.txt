This workflow:
- creates a given directory as a workspace
- for each field in a given list of fields, creates a report of counts of distinct
values
- wraps up the workflow
Example command-line usage:
kurator -f file_term_values_yw.yaml
-p workspace=./file_term_values_workspace
-p inputfile=../data/tests/test_barcelona1_clean.txt
-p format=txt
-p fieldlist="genus|specificepithet"
-l DEBUG (optional)
Requires:
jython pip install requests
jython pip install python-dwca-reader
jython pip install py
jython pip install unicodecsv
jython pip install unidecode

## The named workflow ###
Actors invoked in the workflow. Every actor that will be invoked must be on this
list. Though the order does not matter, it is helpful to keep the list in more
or less the order in which they'll be invoked, for clarity.
Each parameter defined here enters the workflow from the command line and is
delivered in the options dictionary of the specified actor.
Accept a parameter called workspace from the command line.
Set the workspace in the options dictionary of MakeWorkspace from the value
of the workspace parameter given on the command line.
Accept a parameter called inputfile from the command line.
Set the inputfile in the options dictionary of ExtractVocabulary from the
value of the inputfile parameter given on the command line.
Accept a parameter called format from the command line.
Set the encoding in the options dictionary of CountFieldValues from the value
of the encoding parameter given on the command line.
Set the format in the options dictionary of CountFieldValues from the value
of the format parameter given on the command line.
Accept a parameter called fieldlist from the command line.
Set the fieldlist in the options dictionary of CountFieldValues from the value
of the format parameter given on the command line.
Example: 'country|state|county|year'
@begin MakeWorkspace
@param workspace
@out options.success
@out options.workspace
@out options.message
@out options.outputfile
@out options
Inline python actor to make a workspace on the fly to use for writing temporary
if one is not supplied in the workflow-defined parameters. It creates a unique
workspace if a workspace location is not explicitly provided, or if the provided
one does not exist.
Inline python code to run.
The function to run when an on_start message is received. Accepts a dictionary
of options.
## Started %s ###' % actor
@end MakeWorkspace

@out counteroptions
@out counteroptions.outputfile
@out results
@out outputoptions
Inline python actor to create distinct value counts all DwC terms recommended to follow
controlled vocabularies.
Inline python code to run.
The function to run when an on_data message is received. Accepts a dictionary
of options.
## Started %s ###' % actor
Get the format for the output files, with 'csv' as the default
Figure out the input file encoding first. It will make things much faster
to know it in advance and pass that information to various steps.
Get the encoding for the input file from the options dictionary
Create a cleaned list of fields from the input file
Turn the input fieldlist into a cleaned list
Get a list of fields from those of interest that actually exist in the
inputfile
Prepare the output dictionary
Cycle through all of the fields of interest in the inputfile
Prepare the options dictionary for the term_value_count_reporter
Create the reports
A list of parameters to get from the options dictionary passed from an
upstream actor.
Get the inputfile for this actor from the outputfile in the options dictionary.
Get the workspace for this actor from the workspace in the options dictionary.
Get the success state from the options dictionary of the previous step
Get the message from the options dictionary of the previous step
The "upstream" actor from which to receive a message.
@end CountFieldValues
@begin WrapUp

@param messagefrom
Inline python actor to take care of any unfinished business and finish the workflow.
Inline python code to run.
The function to run when an on_data message is received. Accepts a dictionary
of options.
## Started %s ###' % actor
## Finished Wrapup ###'
A list of parameters to get from the options dictionary passed from an
upstream actor.
Get the workspace for this actor from the workspace in the options dictionary.
Get the success state from the options dictionary of the previous step
Get the message from the options dictionary of the previous step
Show the name of the upstream actor.
The "upstream" actor from which to receive a message.
